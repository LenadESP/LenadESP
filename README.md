ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LenadESP! Iâ€™m currently learningâ€”though I donâ€™t know exactly what, since I love learning and I'm interested in everything! Haha. I think we can be friends!
Since Iâ€™m Spanish, I might make some mistakes when speaking English, so feel free to correct me.
No need to mention that Iâ€™m obviously fluent in Spanish, as itâ€™s my native language.
I love reading, and I have a great time enjoying manga or watching anime! :D
