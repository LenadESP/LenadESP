- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LenadESP. Im actualy learning, I don't know exactly what as I love learning and I'm into everything HAHA. I think that we can be friends!
- Since I'm Spanish I may make some mistakes speaking english, so feel free to correct if so.
- No need to mention that I am obviously also fluent in Spanish, wich is my mother language.
- I love reading and I have a great time reading mangas or watching anime :D.
